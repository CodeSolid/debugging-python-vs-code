# VS Code Debug Configuration Files

This directory contains the debug configuration files mentioned in the [closing thougts](https://codesolid.com/debugging-python-in-vs-code/#htoc-closing-thoughts) section of the article [Debugging Python in VS Code](https://codesolid.com/debugging-python-in-vs-code).

Most of these were created in Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft Python extension installed and with an active python file in the current editor. With those prerequisites, you can create and customize any of the files here using Run and Debug button located on the primary left hand sidebar of VS Code and clicking the link there that says "create a launch.json file."  

That's the recommended way to get these. These files are simply here as a reference for those who'd like to see what's available by default.

## Current file configurations

The two files for launching the current file show the initial state and the modifications as discussed in the article linked above.  These files are:

* launch.json.current-python-file
* launch.json.current-python-file-modified
